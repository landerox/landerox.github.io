# :material-hand-wave: Hi, I'm Fernando

> *Senior Data Engineer with 6+ years designing and implementing scalable cloud data solutions on Google Cloud Platform.*

## :material-briefcase-variant: What I Do

I specialize in building enterprise-grade data pipelines, MLOps infrastructure, and data architectures. My work spans ETL/ELT pipelines at scale with BigQuery, Dataflow, and Cloud Composer, as well as Vertex AI integrations for model deployment and governance.

## :material-target: Current Focus

- Advanced RAG systems with production-grade retrieval-augmented generation
- Data Mesh architectures for enterprise scalability
- MLOps best practices and governance frameworks
- Engineering standards and reusable patterns

## :material-history: Background

Years ago, I was a teenager in Venezuela reading every electronic magazine I could find and lurking in IRC channels on Dalnet. Fast forward through Counter-Strike tournaments at cyber cafes, LAN competitions, and paintball matches in the Viper League—that curiosity never faded. It just evolved into designing scalable data systems and experimenting with AI.

The search for knowledge never ends. *Still following the white rabbit* 🐇
