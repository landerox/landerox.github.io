# :material-hand-wave: Welcome to landerox.com

> Hi, I'm Fernando Landero **Senior Data Engineer** with **6+ years** designing and implementing scalable cloud data solutions on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. Specialized in DataOps and MLOps for enterprise environments.

## :material-briefcase-variant: What I Do

I specialize in building enterprise-grade data pipelines, MLOps infrastructure, and data architectures. My work spans ETL/ELT pipelines at scale with BigQuery, Dataflow, and Cloud Composer, as well as Vertex AI integrations for model deployment and governance.

### Core Impact & Experience

* **High-Volume Orchestration:** Managed complex pipelines processing massive data volumes with high reliability using Cloud Composer (Airflow) and Kubernetes.
* **MLOps Governance:** Automated Vertex AI notebooks and implemented CI/CD for streamlined model training, deployment, and governance frameworks.
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Configured and managed GCP environments (service accounts, access controls, security) using **Terraform** for efficiency and governance.

## :material-target: Current Focus

* **Advanced RAG systems** with production-grade retrieval-augmented generation.
* **Data Mesh architectures** for enterprise scalability and governance.
* **MLOps best practices** and model/dataset versioning (ensuring performance monitoring and drift detection).
* **Engineering standards** and reusable Python/GCP patterns.

## :material-history: Background

Years ago, I was a teenager in Venezuela reading every electronic magazine I could find and lurking in IRC channels on Dalnet. Fast forward through Counter-Strike tournaments at cyber cafes, LAN competitions, and paintball matches in the Viper League—that curiosity never faded. It just evolved into designing scalable data systems and experimenting with AI.

The search for knowledge never ends.
