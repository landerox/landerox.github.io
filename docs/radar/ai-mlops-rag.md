# :material-brain: AI Strategy, MLOps & RAG Systems

> Moving beyond notebooks into production-grade AI systems and governance.

* **[Chip Huyen's ML Engineering](https://huyenchip.com/blog/){ target="_blank" }**: World-class resources on Real-time ML and designing machine learning systems for production.
* **[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/){ target="_blank" }**: The hub of modern AI. Critical for finding open-source models, datasets, and understanding the state-of-the-art outside of proprietary APIs.
* **[LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/){ target="_blank" }**: My preference for complex RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) data ingestion strategies.
* **[LMSYS Chatbot Arena](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard){ target="_blank" }**: The open platform for evaluating LLMs by human preference. The definitive leaderboard I check to assess model performance (Elo ratings) before selection.
* **[Martin Fowler’s MLOps Guide](https://martinfowler.com/articles/cd4ml.html){ target="_blank" }**: Foundational reading on "Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning" (CD4ML). A strict engineering approach to ML lifecycles.
* **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/){ target="_blank" }**: Essential for running and benchmarking open-source LLMs (Llama 3, Mistral) locally without cloud latency.
* **[OWASP Top 10 for LLM](https://genai.owasp.org/){ target="_blank" }**: The standard for securing Large Language Model applications. Critical for preventing Prompt Injection and data leakage in RAG systems.
* **[Vertex AI Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs){ target="_blank" }**: The enterprise backbone for training, deploying, and governing models on GCP. Focus on "Model Garden" and "Generative AI".
