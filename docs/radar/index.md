# :material-radar: Tech Radar

> A curated collection of tools, frameworks, and resources I actively use and recommend for Data Engineering, MLOps, and Cloud-Native development.

**Last updated:** December 2025

## :material-filter-outline: Selection Criteria

This radar reflects tools I actively use or have thoroughly evaluated. Selection is based on:

- **Production readiness** — Battle-tested in real workloads
- **Community & maintenance** — Active development and ecosystem support
- **Developer experience** — Prioritizing tools that reduce friction
- **Performance** — Especially relevant for data engineering and Rust tooling

*Tools move in and out based on the evolving landscape.*
